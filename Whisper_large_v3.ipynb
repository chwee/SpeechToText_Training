Hi, is this Sunny Nathans? Yes, speaking. Hi, Sunny. This is Mihir calling from IPP. Is this a good time to speak with you? Calling from? IPP. Are you a bit busy, or is this a good time? You're calling from where? I didn't get from where you're calling? Right. It's IPP. So basically, your details are passed on to me by a senior consultant. Her name's Elena Prio. So she had reached out to you a couple of years ago, and your details were here for me to follow up. So I just wanted to check. Do you recall Elena Prio reaching out to you on LinkedIn, or is that a slip through the cracks? Maybe LinkedIn get a lot of junk in there anyway. I don't remember, but may I know the context of this call? Right, Sunny. So very quickly, IPP is in. We are Singapore's largest and oldest financial institution, and we specifically help expats and PRs in Singapore with financial advisory. So we do offshore investment planning from unit trusts to insurance products. We also do international mortgages, tax-efficient planning, basically an A to Z of financial planning. And we sell products from mostly all insurance companies here in Singapore. So that really helps our clients as well. I wanted to check with you. Who might be key? Who might be key to sort of explore our solutions? Maybe a 15 to 20-minute Zoom session with our senior consultant. Would that be of your interest? Not of direct interest, but I'm just, like when you say, like what do you do? Can you just in layman's word, like just explain to me how do you help? Right. So we have various types of solutions. So we do the most basic things. So health insurance, life insurance. Which I'm not interested at all. Right. We also do investment planning. So we also do unit trusts. So we have a tie-up with a lot of intermediaries. So fund houses like J.P. Morgan, fund houses like PIMCO, they invest monies in equities and bonds. So we can help in wealth accumulation and wealth creation. Like I said, my senior consultant, Elena Prior, should be in a better position to run you through our exact products. But in any case, if you are in the market, it's a good time because the market is having an optimistic sentiment. But if you're not looking to buy anything, we can still have a chat. We can share with you exactly what we do and exactly how our clients have benefited from this. I don't want to go to a separate call on this. If you just tell me, like what exactly do you do? Right. So we are a financial institution. We're a financial consulting firm. So we help high-network individuals. We help normal retail customers. We help customers to grow their wealth and to increase returns. Which I get. But when you say like so, is it like you ask for funds or you manage my funds or like what? Like exactly, I'm just trying to figure out what do you have? Yes, the management of your funds. So you can invest with us and we can cause the returns. Invest with you? Yes, you can invest your money through us. And then we can sort of help in capital appreciation. Again, I'm getting your, so I have to give you money and you will invest it on my behalf. Or would you like give me guidance on my current portfolios? It can be both. We do both things. So we can also give you a second opinion on existing investments. But you can also invest with us and you can put money through us and grow your capital. But of course, where we put the money will be up to you. Obviously, you will have access to the funds that we invest in. And you can sort of also understand. You know, the exact part of the fund. I'm not too sure. Just drop me an email and if I'm interested, I'll get back to you. Right, right. How would you, would you be interested to jump on a Zoom call with my consultant? Because she's a subject matter. Yeah, I don't have time to do that. And I think I've seen like multiple emails from her on my LinkedIn and I didn't realize. But I'm not clear. Like I get so many of such similar emails. But if you can just tell me exactly what you guys do and like if I find it interesting. But right now, it just seems like a spam kind of thing. I understand, I understand. So the reason I'm asking for a Zoom call is because she's a subject matter expert on financials. I'm more of a client acquisition. I don't know. On a Saturday noon, like 20 minutes max of your time. I'm there. I'm in a position to help you. Yeah, I've been traveling and I'm traveling from the Saturday again for the whole week. Exactly next week. And then again, so if you can just drop me an email. But like step, I'll go to the email. I'll get back to you so that we don't waste your time also. Like key thing that I want to know. I just want to know how do you add value. Okay. And what are the mechanics of it? Right. I don't want to. I don't want. Let me give you another insurance or a health insurance advice. Okay. Like I don't want this. Oh, no, this is not health insurance. If you don't want health insurance, we can also do other. I don't want life insurance. Like, I just want to know exactly like what, how do you have one, two, three days. And in fact, to be honest, I am looking for a financial consultant to manage both phone for me in India. So it's not like I'm not. But I do want to know. But in that process, I'm going through so many. Okay. junk discussions. That's like just bothering and understand. Okay. How about I do this? How about I ask Elena prior to give you a voice call? She'll be in a very much better place to actually address your exact concern. No, as I told you, like, you've gotten on the call right now. Just send me an email if it is of interest and I'll get back to you. And I don't want like a massive email. Just like five lines would do on what do you guys do. Just that. Okay. One is, could I get your email and sort of send some information on that, you know. Please don't send me a brochure with like hundreds. It's not like I'm not a corporate company or anything. Just like five sentences or four sentences like which tells what you guys do. So that next time like any particular interest I'll get back to Elena or you. Like I'll reply to the email and we could set up a Zoom call and we take it forward. Got it, Sonny. Got it. No worries. Okay. Could I get your email so I can sort of send it there? Sure. S-O-N-N-Y J-M-A-T-H-E-W-S Okay. So Sonny J. Matthews. Yeah. All right. I'll send you an email by today so you can review it at your time. Okay. Thanks so much. Thank you so much for your call. Bye.

So very quickly, IPP is in.\n","[55.80s -> 64.42s]  We are Singapore's largest and oldest financial institution, and we specifically help expats and PRs in Singapore with financial advisory.\n","[64.60s -> 69.06s]  So we do offshore investment planning from unit trusts to insurance products.\n","[69.28s -> 75.22s]  We also do international mortgages, tax-efficient planning, basically an A to Z of financial planning.\n","[75.76s -> 80.02s]  And we sell products from mostly all insurance companies here in Singapore.\n","[80.02s -> 83.40s]  So that really helps our clients as well.\n","[83.92s -> 84.94s]  I wanted to check with you.\n","[84.98s -> 85.78s]  Who might be key?\n","[85.80s -> 88.46s]  Who might be key to sort of explore our solutions?\n","[88.64s -> 91.92s]  Maybe a 15 to 20-minute Zoom session with our senior consultant.\n","[93.02s -> 94.26s]  Would that be of your interest?\n","[96.28s -> 104.68s]  Not of direct interest, but I'm just, like when you say, like what do you do?\n","[105.06s -> 108.42s]  Can you just in layman's word, like just explain to me how do you help?\n","[109.30s -> 109.66s]  Right.\n","[109.74s -> 112.58s]  So we have various types of solutions.\n","[112.58s -> 115.34s]  So we do the most basic things.\n","[115.34s -> 116.80s]  So health insurance, life insurance.\n","[117.36s -> 118.62s]  Which I'm not interested at all.\n","[119.38s -> 119.58s]  Right.\n","[119.62s -> 120.74s]  We also do investment planning.\n","[120.88s -> 123.54s]  So we also do unit trusts.\n","[123.68s -> 127.28s]  So we have a tie-up with a lot of intermediaries.\n","[127.80s -> 133.54s]  So fund houses like J.P. Morgan, fund houses like PIMCO, they invest monies in equities and bonds.\n","[133.90s -> 137.24s]  So we can help in wealth accumulation and wealth creation.\n","[137.24s -> 144.56s]  Like I said, my senior consultant, Elena Prior, should be in a better position to run you through our exact products.\n","[145.34s -> 152.20s]  But in any case, if you are in the market, it's a good time because the market is having an optimistic sentiment.\n","[152.36s -> 155.50s]  But if you're not looking to buy anything, we can still have a chat.\n","[155.58s -> 159.74s]  We can share with you exactly what we do and exactly how our clients have benefited from this.\n","[160.42s -> 163.56s]  I don't want to go to a separate call on this.\n","[163.70s -> 166.16s]  If you just tell me, like what exactly do you do?\n","[167.58s -> 167.98s]  Right.\n","[168.10s -> 170.24s]  So we are a financial institution.\n","[170.40s -> 171.76s]  We're a financial consulting firm.\n","[171.76s -> 174.04s]  So we help high-network individuals.\n","[174.22s -> 175.16s]  We help normal retail customers.\n","[175.34s -> 178.46s]  We help customers to grow their wealth and to increase returns.\n","[179.68s -> 180.64s]  Which I get.\n","[181.04s -> 189.90s]  But when you say like so, is it like you ask for funds or you manage my funds or like what?\n","[190.12s -> 191.90s]  Like exactly, I'm just trying to figure out what do you have?\n","[192.26s -> 193.58s]  Yes, the management of your funds.\n","[193.70s -> 197.06s]  So you can invest with us and we can cause the returns.\n","[197.06s -> 197.86s]  Invest with you?\n","[198.78s -> 201.64s]  Yes, you can invest your money through us.\n","[201.64s -> 204.62s]  And then we can sort of help in capital appreciation.\n","[205.34s -> 211.48s]  Again, I'm getting your, so I have to give you money and you will invest it on my behalf.\n","[211.48s -> 215.74s]  Or would you like give me guidance on my current portfolios?\n","[217.28s -> 218.34s]  It can be both.\n","[218.44s -> 219.20s]  We do both things.\n","[219.26s -> 221.86s]  So we can also give you a second opinion on existing investments.\n","[222.36s -> 226.16s]  But you can also invest with us and you can put money through us and grow your capital.\n","[226.60s -> 229.04s]  But of course, where we put the money will be up to you.\n","[229.22s -> 232.38s]  Obviously, you will have access to the funds that we invest in.\n","[232.80s -> 234.88s]  And you can sort of also understand.\n","[235.34s -> 239.28s]  You know, the exact part of the fund.\n","[241.08s -> 243.06s]  I'm not too sure.\n","[243.28s -> 245.98s]  Just drop me an email and if I'm interested, I'll get back to you.\n","[246.92s -> 247.38s]  Right, right.\n","[247.66s -> 252.04s]  How would you, would you be interested to jump on a Zoom call with my consultant?\n","[252.36s -> 254.08s]  Because she's a subject matter.\n","[254.56s -> 255.80s]  Yeah, I don't have time to do that.\n","[256.08s -> 261.54s]  And I think I've seen like multiple emails from her on my LinkedIn and I didn't realize.\n","[261.54s -> 262.42s]  But I'm not clear.\n","[262.78s -> 265.02s]  Like I get so many of such similar emails.\n","[265.34s -> 269.78s]  But if you can just tell me exactly what you guys do and like if I find it interesting.\n","[269.90s -> 273.30s]  But right now, it just seems like a spam kind of thing.\n","[273.72s -> 275.46s]  I understand, I understand.\n","[276.00s -> 282.22s]  So the reason I'm asking for a Zoom call is because she's a subject matter expert on financials.\n","[283.02s -> 285.08s]  I'm more of a client acquisition.\n","[285.08s -> 290.62s]  I don't know.\n","[290.94s -> 294.20s]  On a Saturday noon, like 20 minutes max of your time.\n","[294.52s -> 294.74s]  I'm

I don't want.\n","[325.34s -> 329.22s]  Let me give you another insurance or a health insurance advice.\n","[329.30s -> 329.38s]  Okay.\n","[329.74s -> 330.34s]  Like I don't want this.\n","[330.42s -> 331.68s]  Oh, no, this is not health insurance.\n","[331.80s -> 334.62s]  If you don't want health insurance, we can also do other.\n","[334.68s -> 335.86s]  I don't want life insurance.\n","[336.10s -> 340.46s]  Like, I just want to know exactly like what, how do you have one, two, three days.\n","[341.34s -> 348.66s]  And in fact, to be honest, I am looking for a financial consultant to manage both phone for me in India.\n","[349.18s -> 351.14s]  So it's not like I'm not.\n","[351.60s -> 352.64s]  But I do want to know.\n","[352.92s -> 355.26s]  But in that process, I'm going through so many.\n","[355.26s -> 355.30s]  Okay.\n","[355.34s -> 356.28s]  junk discussions.\n","[356.86s -> 357.20s]  That's like\n","[357.20s -> 357.72s]  just
